Job by job extract that have different steps 
each job has different amount of steps

things that might look similar are not similar

Each step of the role
- status
- score
- result

Progress table - status at that point in time 

Demographics against member (back in the day)
maybe against application questionnaires (this is a guess)

What do they want exactly? 

The results could have a 'key' to tell you what sort of question it might be i.e. might be asking for gender in 100 different ways but the key helps you 'fan it in' to one question

stream lit - some sort of library 

What do we do to generate this data?
How do we solve each of the issues
