This seems a lot like dapr where you can have multiple resources into one project and you can name different projects 

for example you can add a reference like sql server and call it `sqlserver` and then when you integrate it into your project you can use the `sqlserver` name in the connection string.

It gives you a dashboard where you can see the logs and traces from the different parts of the application
